// once. Golden files stay readable, a theme can be swapped without re-rendering,
// and downgrading to a 16-colour terminal is purely an emit concern.
//
// Fill is a second key, and it exists because one span could otherwise carry only
// one style. A diff draws a coloured band across the whole row and a syntax
// highlighter draws a green comment on top of it, and those are two different
// decisions by two different pieces of code: the band belongs to the row, the
// green belongs to the token. Emit merges them — Style over Fill — so the token
// keeps its colour without punching a hole in the band. Text and Width ignore it,
// which is why a wash can never move a golden file.
