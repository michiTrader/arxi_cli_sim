// a later delta that closes it, so any renderer that needs a complete document
// before it can produce output shows nothing for 150 ms and then jumps. This one
// runs the state machine over whatever text has arrived and stops where the text
// stops. An unclosed fence simply means the block is still code.
//
// It is deliberately small: headings, emphasis, code spans, links, fenced code,
// lists, quotes and tables. That is what an assistant actually emits. Tables live in
// table.go, because they are the one construct whose layout is a fact about several
// rows at once rather than about the row being drawn.
