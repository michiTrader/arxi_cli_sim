// Tables are the one markdown construct that does not fit the line-at-a-time state
// machine in markdown.go. Every other case decides what a row is by looking at that
// row; a table is only a table once the delimiter row under its header has arrived,
// and its column widths are a fact about all of its rows at once. So it gets a file,
// and RenderMarkdown gets a case that hands it a slice of them.
//
// Two forms, chosen by arithmetic rather than by a flag. Where the columns fit there is
// a grid: the header, a rule under it, a vertical between neighbours, and no outer box
// — a box costs ten columns to repeat what the rule already says, and this interface
// draws a fenced code block with a bare gutter for the same reason. Where they do not
// fit the grid is abandoned rather than squeezed, and the test for that is whether every
// column can still hold its widest whole word: at twenty columns three cells would share
// fourteen, which is a stack of syllables and not a table, and at forty the file names in
// scenario 06 would be cut a letter short of their extension. Each row is drawn as its own
// small record instead. Scenario 02 is the recording that goes down that path and 06 the
// one that stays in the grid at a normal width, which is why both are in the corpus.

// minCol is the narrowest a column may be before the grid stops being worth drawing.
// Eight columns holds a short word or a count like "+9 -2"; below that every cell wraps
// into a column of fragments and the reader is left doing the table's work. It is the
// floor under the word rule in renderTable rather than the usual reason a table stacks:
// at twenty-four columns three cells would share eighteen, which no arithmetic about
// words can rescue, so the arithmetic is not consulted.
